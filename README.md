# Use Infobip Services to Enable Omnichannel Notifications for Acronis Protected Cloud Events

Having notification of something important at the proper time and place is very important. Especially if it's connected to services, you use to protect your IT environment. In this simple example, we look into how any service that supports API to retrieve events or statuses data can be extended with the Infobip suite of services.
As a notification source, we will use Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud as it provides a simple REST API to receive notifications. 

## Get Started

To run the example, you need to have Infobip and Acronis accounts. The great thing is that both services have free developer access to test and develop. If you still don't have any of those services, you need to register as a developer to run the sample.
